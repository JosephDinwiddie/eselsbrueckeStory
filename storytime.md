Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a beautiful princess who loved Bratwurst.
She wore Ledderhose and listened to Rammstein.
One day, she decided to take her Porsche for a spin down Hauptstrasse, enjoying the wind in her hair as she craved some delicious Apfelkuchen from the local bakery.
Soon, she found herself in Berlin.
Herself and countless others would travel from across the world for their famous Biergarten.
After her wild evening the only thing she was able to stomach was plain Brot.
The next morning, she decided to visit Schloss Eltz, but first, she had to make a quick stop at the Baeckerei to pick up some fresh Gebaeck for the road.
She ended her day driving her BMW to Eltz in style.
