Directions: "Step 3) Individually, each of you should go to at least one other GitHub repo from another team (see links on #story channel) and contribute one new sentence to their story. It is your job to find out how you can contribute to a public repository! One of you create a PullRequest.md document on your repository. Into this file each of you should put your name and the link to the PullRequest you created for the other teams repo! If this document is not there and your link is not there you will not get points for this."
